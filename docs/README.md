# 3D Software Renderer

A lightweight, JavaScript-based 3D software renderer capable of rendering any 3D model with interactive controls. This project implements a full rendering pipeline, including transformations, projection, and triangle rasterization, all within a browser environment.

## Overview

This renderer supports loading and displaying 3D models defined by vertices, indices, and colors. It features a customizable camera system, rotation controls, and a scalable architecture, making it suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or as a foundation for more complex graphics applications.

- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Environment**: Browser (HTML5 Canvas)
- **License**: MIT

## Features

- **Versatile 3D Rendering**: Renders any 3D model using a software-based pipeline (no WebGL).
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust rotation speed and view angle with sliders.
- **Transformation Support**: Includes translation, rotation (X, Y, Z), scaling, and perspective projection.
- **Color Interpolation**: Smooth shading across triangle surfaces.
- **Real-Time Animation**: Continuous rendering with `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Reset Functionality**: Returns to initial state with a button click.
