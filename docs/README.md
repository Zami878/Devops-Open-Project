3D Software Renderer

A lightweight, JavaScript-based 3D software renderer capable of rendering any 3D model with interactive controls. This project showcases the implementation of a complete rendering pipeline, including transformations, perspective projection, and triangle rasterisation, all within a browser environment using HTML5 Canvas.


Overview

The 3D software renderer enables loading and displaying 3D models defined by vertices, indices, and colors. It includes:
- A customizable camera system.
- Interactive rotation controls.
- Scalable architecture suitable for:
  - Educational purposes.
  - Rapid prototyping.
  - Building a foundation for advanced graphics applications.


Technical Details
- Language: JavaScript.
- Environment: Browser (HTML5 Canvas).
  


Key Features
1. Versatile 3D Rendering:  
   Renders 3D models using a software-based pipeline without relying on Webgl.
2. Interactive Controls:
   Adjust rotation speed and view angles seamlessly using slider inputs.
3. Transformation Support: 
   Implements essential transformations like translation, rotation (X, Y, Z), scaling, and perspective projection.
4. Colour Interpolation: 
   Provides smooth shading across triangle surfaces for visual clarity.
5. Real-Time Animation:  
   Continuous rendering is enabled via `requestAnimationFrame` for fluid animations.
6. Reset Functionality:
   Allows users to return to the initial state with a simple button click.


Setup
Prerequisites:
- Git: Ensure Git is installed for version control and managing repositories.
- Modern Browser: Use browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for running the HTML5 Canvas environment.
